### Website Title and Description

## Responsive Portfoilo

Rekha Kumariâ€™s Portfolio: This is my personal website developed for future employers to be able to access my projects and contact me. My website has Bootstrap components and grid system.

# How to access?
The website can be found at the following address: https://nikstar-1.github.io/02-Responsive-Portfolio/

 The website has been developed in the following ways:

- Navbar on each page contains links to Home/About, Contact, and portfolio pages, workable and consistent on each page.
- Responsive layout across all pages to fit XS screens as well as desktop allowing for margins on the left and right of my screen.
- Responsive Images
- Each page has semantic html
- Contains personal information 

This project has been an exciting, and challenging development, enjoyed using bootstrap components, slightly tricky at first but enjoyed learning as I went along.
