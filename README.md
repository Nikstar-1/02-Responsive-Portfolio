 The website has been developed in the following ways:

- Navbar on each page contains links to Home/About, Contact, and portfolio pages, workable and consistent on each page.
- Responsive layout across all pages to fit XS screens as well as desktop allowing for margins on the left and right of my screen.
- Responsive Images
- Each page has semantic html
- Contains personal information 

This project has been an exciting, and challenging development, enjoyed using bootstrap components, slightly tricky at first but enjoyed learning as I went along.
